immplement wheighted (un-directed) graph 

This project models data structures on weighted (un-directed) graphs, especially finding the shortest path and deciding whether the graph is connected or not.
We will use the data structures Hash Map for saving collection of nodes for each graph- saving objects by their key,
and also for saving collection of neighbors for each node- saving the key of the neighbor and the weight.
This data structures provides us easy way to get the nodes (by their key) , without knowing how many nodes will have in advance.
